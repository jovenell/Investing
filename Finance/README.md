1. Portfolio Theory & Asset Pricing
Markowitz Mean‑Variance Framework – chooses an “efficient” mix of risky assets by balancing expected return against variance.

Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) – links an asset’s expected excess return to its beta (systematic risk) versus the market.

Fama–French 3‑/5‑Factor Models – extend CAPM with size, value, profitability, and investment factors to better explain returns.

Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) – prices assets using multiple macro‑factor betas without specifying the market portfolio.

Consumption‑CAPM (C‑CAPM) – prices assets off marginal utility of consumption growth (foundation for intertemporal models).

2. Corporate Finance & Valuation
Discounted Cash‑Flow (DCF) – values a business by projecting free cash flow and discounting at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).

Dividend Discount / Gordon Growth Model – special DCF case that grows dividends at a constant rate.

Modigliani–Miller (M‑M) Propositions – show how capital structure and payout policy affect (or do not affect) firm value under different frictions.

Adjusted Present Value (APV) – values projects by adding the base NPV to the tax shield from financing.

Real Options Analysis – values managerial flexibility (e.g., abandon, expand) using option‑pricing logic.

3. Fixed‑Income & Interest‑Rate Models
Macaulay & Modified Duration / Convexity – measure a bond’s price sensitivity to yield changes.

Nelson–Siegel & Svensson Term‑Structure Models – fit and forecast the yield curve with just a few parameters.

Vasicek & Cox‑Ingersoll‑Ross (CIR) – short‑rate models that describe the stochastic evolution of interest rates.

Ho–Lee, Black–Derman–Toy Trees – recombining lattices used for interest‑rate derivatives and callable bonds.

4. Derivatives Pricing
Black‑Scholes‑Merton (BSM) – closed‑form option valuation under log‑normal price dynamics; foundation for the Greeks.

Binomial & Trinomial Trees – lattice methods that converge to BSM and handle early‑exercise features (e.g., American options).

Heston Stochastic Volatility Model – prices options when volatility itself follows a diffusion.

Monte Carlo Simulation – flexible, model‑agnostic engine for pricing complex path‑dependent derivatives.

5. Risk Management
Value at Risk (VaR) – quantifies potential portfolio loss over a horizon at a given confidence level.

Expected Shortfall / Conditional VaR – averages losses beyond the VaR threshold; coherent risk measure.

GARCH Family (ARCH, GARCH, EGARCH, etc.) – models and forecasts time‑varying volatility for risk and option pricing.

CreditMetrics / CreditRisk+ / KMV – structural and reduced‑form frameworks for portfolio credit risk.

6. Econometrics & Forecasting
Ordinary & Generalized Least Squares (OLS, GLS) – backbone for estimating factor betas and cost of capital.

Vector Autoregression (VAR) & Vector Error‑Correction (VECM) – capture dynamic interactions and cointegration among macro or asset variables.

Event Study Methodology – measures abnormal returns around corporate or macro announcements.

7. Alternative & Advanced Topics
Factor Mimicking Portfolios (e.g., SMB, HML) – practical construction of risk factors used in multi‑factor models.

Kelly Criterion – sets optimal bet size for repeated gambles/trades given edge and odds.

Copula Models – join marginal distributions into a multivariate distribution, crucial for structured‑credit pricing.
